# [Week 2 - Delete Item from List]({% post_url 2019-03-01-week2 %})

https://github.com/MaitreyiJadhav/Todo-App 

- In this project so far I can add an item through the input box and the item gets added to the list in the form of an array.
- For this week I was supposed to have the delete button working for my todo item. 
- However, due to other project 2 commitments, I could not complete the delete functionality.
- I have added a delete button which gets added next to the newly added item in the list.
