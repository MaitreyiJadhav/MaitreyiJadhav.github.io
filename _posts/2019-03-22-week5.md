# [Week 5 - Add Check button on todo item]({% post_url 2019-03-22-week5 %}) 

- This week I worked on minor css changes, for instance the input field text was too small. 
- I also added a check box button, user can click on this button to check the items they have completed from the todo list/     notes.
- For next week I am learning how to delete an item from the list and the same to reflect on my realtime database in firebase.
