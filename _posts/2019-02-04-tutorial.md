# [Tutorial - Build a simple website using Jade, Express, Nodemailer Contact Form]({% post_url 2019-02-04-tutorial %})

 - This is a tutorial to set up a simple website which contains three pages, **Home**, **About** and **Contact**.
 - For setting up the server on localhost, creating routes and making sure the routes render the correct page we will use  -      **Express Node.js**. 
 - For the mock write-up/content of the website we will use the templating engine **Jade**.
 - On the Contact page, we will have a fully functional contact form for users to leave comments on our website/ ask              questions. This will be accomplished using the **Nodemailer** module from Node.js


## Express
  - Express is a Node.js web application framework which simplifies server side web application.
  - Express's increasing popularity is seen in building Web and Mobile Applications, creating robust APIs, its performance and      frameworks based on Express.

## Jade - Templating Engine 
  - Jade is a language for producing HTML templates.
  - It is used for server side programming in Node.js
  - Jade has a number of advantages over using plain HTML.
   - Code Reusability
   - Organised Code
   - Code can be easily maintained and produced using Jade or any templating engine. 
   - **Code Inheritance**, similar to how other object oriented langauges work, jade allows inheritance of templates. This          means that code from one page/template can be used on other templates using 'extends'. This helps us avoid repition of        code.
   - More documentation is avialable on the links below.

1.Project folder overview
========

For this project I have used VSCode which can be downloaded from here
[https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

VSCode comes with an  integrated terminal which is a pretty neat feature to avoid switching between window screens.

2.Install Node.js, npm on your platform
======

To check if you have node and npm installed type 
 **node –v**
 **npm –v**
   
This will give you the version of node and npm which means it is installed on your machine. If not, here is a link to install nodejs [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

If you have a Mac and have Homebrew installed, you can install in just few moments by typing following command in your terminal.

**$brew install node**
**$brew install npm**

3.In your terminal
======

Open your terminal/ comand prompt in your preferred directory on your computer and type:

**mkdir Tutorial**
**cd mkdir**

This will creata a folder called **Tutorial** and will make sure you working directory is the same. 

We will initialize npm now and link it to our project. Type **npm init** this will create the package.json file in your project root folder.

It will also prompt for the following, you can keep hitting enter all the way through the list, leave the defaults, and just give author name,description to your project but make sure you change entry point to **app.js**. 


entry point: (index.js) 
Change this to:
**app.js*

You can switch over to VSCode now and open your project, if you open your **package.json** you should see something like this:
