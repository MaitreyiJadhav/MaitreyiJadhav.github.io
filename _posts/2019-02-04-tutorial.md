# [Tutorial - Build a simple website using Jade, Express, Nodemailer Contact Form]({% post_url 2019-02-04-tutorial %})

 - This is a tutorial to set up a simple website which contains three pages, **Home**, **About** and **Contact**.
 - For setting up the server on localhost, creating routes and making sure the routes render the correct page we will use  -      **Express Node.js**. 
 - For the mock write-up/content of the website we will use the templating engine **Jade**.
 - On the Contact page, we will have a fully functional contact form for users to leave comments on our website/ ask              questions. This will be accomplished using the **Nodemailer** module from Node.js

## Jade - Templating Engine 
  - Jade is a language for producing HTML templates.
  - It is used for server side programming in Node.js
  - Jade has a number of advantages over using plain HTML.
   - Code Reusability
   - Organised Code
   - Code can be easily maintained and produced using Jade or any templating engine. 
   - **Code Inheritance**, similar to how other object oriented langauges work, jade allows inheritance of templates. This          means that code from one page/template can be used on other templates using 'extends'. This helps us avoid repition of        code.
   - More documentation is avialable on the links below.

SETTING UP PROJECT FOLDER
======

For this project I have used VSCode which can be downloaded from here [https://code.visualstudio.com/download)(https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

VSCode comes with an  integrated terminal which is a pretty neat feature to avoid switching between window screens.
