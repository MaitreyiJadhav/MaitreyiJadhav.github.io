The popularity of Node.js is increasing day by day for SPAs. During my job market research I came across the fact that when applying for jobs in Web Development, Node.js is the language in demand. To explore the language, get a basic understanding to build more complex applications I have chosen to make a simple website which uses Contact Form on a website using Node.js and nodemailer module from Node.js. I am keen on learning Node.js because of its robust and light weight features to build web and mobile applications. 

My tutorial will be aimed at walking a novice through installing Node.js, npm, set up their server on localhost, build a basic hello world, render more than one html pages, and using nodemailer module of Node.js build a Contact Form.
