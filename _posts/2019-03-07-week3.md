# [Week 3 - Connect App to Firebase]({% post_url 2019-03-07-week3 %})


- Since I was currently saving all my todos in an array, this week I am learning how to connect my app to Firebase.
- Firebase configuration is stored in **environment.ts** inside  **environments**
- Next step is to create the connection between firebase and the app.
- In angular app firebase modules need to be added in **app.module.ts** and firebase needs to be installed using **npm install   @angular/fire --save
- Next step will be to add and delete a todo item in the database created on firebase. 

```
import { AngularFireModule } from 'angularfire2';
import { AngularFireDatabaseModule } from 'angularfire2/database';

```
