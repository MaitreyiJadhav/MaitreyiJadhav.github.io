# [Presentation - AngularJS]({% post_url 2019-02-14-Presentation %})

# What is AngularJS?
- Angular is a JavaScript structural framework used to build dynamic web apps. It is a client-side technology and provides a powerful way of extending HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is best suited for single page applications. Angular extends HTML with **ng-directives** - **ng-app, ng-model, ng-bind**.

# Why AngularJS?

- [https://www.madewithangular.com/about/](https://www.madewithangular.com/about/)
Not only the bigger companies around the world are using Angular but even the smaller companies choose Angular for the scalability it offers.

- Angular has a larger community which will make it easier to learn the language for a beginner. With a larger community comes reliability. 

- Angular is one of the most common frameworks alongwith React and Vue and I believe it will be a good skill to learn in 2019. 

# Note Taking App in AngularJS

- For the presentation of this term I will build an app with following functionality:
 - Take daily notes
 - Add an item to the list
 - Delete an item from the list
 - On the backend the app will interact with MongoDB
 
- This app will meet the basic **CRUD** functionalities.
