## Prerequisites 

[https://angular.io/guide/quickstart](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart)

Node.js
Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x.

To check your version, run node -v in a terminal/console window.

To get Node.js, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)


**npm install -g @angular/cli**

**ng serve --open**

**ng serve --open --port 4200** 
This will open the app directly on http://localhost:4200/

## Goals
For this project and presenatation I have achieved all my goals that I had in the beginning of the project. 

## Lessons learned and unexpected challenges
The biggest challenge I faced was in the beginning, I had no prior experience in Angular, I had no clue as to where to start. 
Then I found this tutorial [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNCzuSryJHE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNCzuSryJHE) and I based my application on this. This tutorial explained to me exactly how things are to be done, firebase connection etc.

Also while adding the **todo list created at date**, I coud only display the current date the list item/ note was added, i tried to add the time in **HH:MM:SS format** but I could not get that to work.

Learning Angular was very much fun but at the same time challenging since I have very scanty prior experience with coding and databases. I am also glad that I learnt how to connect the front end to the back end via database. I can now call myself slightly more familiar with MVC architecture than I was before this term started. Since my prototype is heavily based on the tutorial, my own added feature is the **date of the todo item** even being able to add that one small feature on the prototype by myself is satisfying, because in the beginning I was very much all over the place. 

I have learned quiet a bit of the theorotical stuff behind angular:
- how components work
- MVC Architecture
- Directives
- Two way data binding
- Templating
- how to choose the right frame work for your project

## Future Work

For my future work for this prototype more work can be potentially done on creating a sorted list of the completed todos.

I am now confident enough to say that with whatever knowledge I have gained over the past four weeks, I can build another small functional prototype in Angular on my own and be able to connect it with a database. And/or implement something similar using React, since React is also a component based library.
