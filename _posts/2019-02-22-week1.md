For week 1, I am getting familiar with 
 - setting up angular evnironment
 - understanding the file structure
 - Angular directives, components and get an overview of data-binding
 
I will be using VSCode for this project.

Pre-requisites for Angular application are
 - Node.js
 - npm package manager
 - Angular CLI
 
 Node.js and npm are already running on my computer. 
 To install the Angular CLI we need to run the following in terminal: 
 
  ```
 npm install -g @angular/cli
 
   ```
 Once Angular CLI is installed we are ready to create our first app, and set up the environment using the terminal.
 
   ```
ng new todo-app
cd todo-app
ng serve ntodo-app
ng serve --open

  ```
Now on http://localhost:4200/ our Anuglar App will be running. If this port is busy we can use another port 

 ```
ng serve --port 3000
 ```
So far I have a basic app in angular which stores the todo item from user inout in an array. 

I have learnt the basics from Angular Documentation and this tutorial [https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-how-to-create-your-first-angular-app-in-20-min-146201d9b5a7](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-how-to-create-your-first-angular-app-in-20-min-146201d9b5a7)

So far I have..
